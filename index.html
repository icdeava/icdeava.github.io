<h2>Impact of reconfiguration frequency</h2>

Here, we illustrate the effect of the frequency of reconfigurations on the throughput and latency of Ava-Bftsmart. We experiment on a system with two clusters, where each has 10 replicas, and each has a client that issues transaction requests and another client that issues an increased load of reconfiguration requests. Reconfigurations begin at approximately 80 seconds. 
We experiment with two frequencies:
(1) once every 20 seconds, and
(2) continuously, without any delay between reconfiguration requests.

<h2>Impact of Network Latency</h2>

<div style="max-width: 600px; margin: left;">
Here, we experiment on a system with two clusters where each has 10 replicas, and each has a client that issues reconfiguration requests. We fixed one cluster at us-west1-b, and experimented with several locations for the second cluster: us-east5-c, asia-northeast1-b, europe-west3-c, and asia-south1-c, with latencies of 52ms, 91ms, 142ms, and 219ms to the first cluster, respectively. 
As the network latency increases, the inter-cluster communication (in phase 2) dominates the performance, and the impact of reconfigurations (in phase 1) diminishes.
